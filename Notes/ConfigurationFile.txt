CF = configuration file

- For each PORT the SERVER needs to listen to, a 'server block' needs to exist in the CF
- A SERVER can have different rules for each PATH, described in a 'location block'.


Default rules:

NAME			- might not be needed
PORT			- which port to listen to
HOST			- IP address of the server machine
METHODS			- which methods are allowed by default
ROOT			- relative path to the folder the client requests from
INDEX			- the file the client gets if no other file is given
ERROR_PAGES		- the relative path to the error pages


Location rules:

METHODS			- tells which rules are allowed
ROOT			- the relative path to the folder the client requests from, if a specific location is given
BODY_SIZE		- the maximum size of the body of the message
INDEX			- the file the client gets if no other file is given
RETURN			- returns another folder or file (and possibly an error) to the client
CGI_EXT			- the extensions that are allowed in 



Handling:

- The server parses the CF.
- For each server block:
	- Sets the default variables.
	- Sets the variables of each location block.
